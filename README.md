# webxr-native
A WebXR polyfill for building native apps to iOS, Android and Desktop using Capacitor and Electron.

NOTE: This project is under active development and testing. The API was originally designed to serve Capacitor only, and is being rewritten to XR compliance. If you need a cross platform native or iOS browser compatible solution immediately, create a Github issue or email us.
